# Udacity - Practical Statistics
## Analyze AB Test
## Overview
This was my second project in my first class with Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I learned about the process of AB testing with statistics. 
In this project I analyzed whether or not a company should implement a new website or keep its old one based on user's interactions with both. I created
a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis and tested the null. I then performed a z-test and performed regression on the data. I failed to reject the
null hypothesis, so the old page was kept instead of implementing the new page.
